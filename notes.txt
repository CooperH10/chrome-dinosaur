what we did
- first we simplified the game a little, got rid of birds
- gave the computer control of the game and created a training mode where the game restarted for a given number of episodes
- discussed how to measure state space --> time to obstacle instead of obstacle position?? yes (jumping height/time is standard regardless of speed)
- wrote the update function to calculate q-values at every point of the training process
